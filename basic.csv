Source: http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html",July 2017,"As of July 2017, the AAT contains around 60,000 records and 375,000 terms. Among these, there are 15,420 candidate records still in process.","Associated Concepts: This facet contains abstract concepts and phenomena that relate to the study and execution of a wide range of human thought and activity, including architecture and art in all media, as well as related disciplines. Also covered here are theoretical and critical concerns, ideologies, attitudes, and social or cultural movements (e.g., beauty, balance, connoisseurship, metaphor, freedom, socialism). 

Physical Attributes: This facet concerns the perceptible or measurable characteristics of materials and artifacts as well as features of materials and artifacts that are not separable as components. Included are characteristics such as size and shape, chemical properties of materials, qualities of texture and hardness, and features such as surface ornament and color (e.g., strapwork, borders, round, waterlogged, brittleness). 

Styles and Periods: This facet provides commonly accepted terms for stylistic groupings and distinct chronological periods that are relevant to art, architecture, and the decorative arts (e.g., French, Louis XIV, Xia, Black-figure, Abstract Expressionist). 

Agents: The Agents facet contains terms for designations of people, groups of people, and organizations identified by occupation or activity, by physical or mental characteristics, or by social role or condition (e.g., printmakers, landscape architects, corporations, religious orders). Animals and plants are also gradually being added to the Living Organisms hierarchy of this facet. 

Activities: This facet encompasses areas of endeavor, physical and mental actions, discrete occurrences, systematic sequences of actions, methods employed toward a certain end, and processes occurring in materials or objects. Activities may range from branches of learning and professional fields to specific life events, from mentally executed tasks to processes performed on or with materials and objects, from single physical actions to complex games (e.g., archaeology, engineering, analyzing, contests, exhibitions, running, drawing (image-making), corrosion). 

Materials: The Materials facet deals with physical substances, whether naturally or synthetically derived. These range from specific materials to types of materials designed by their function, such as colorants, and from raw materials to those that have been formed or processed into products that are used in fabricating structures or objects (e.g., iron, clay, adhesive, emulsifier, artificial ivory, millwork). 

Objects: The Objects facet is the largest of all the AAT facets. It encompasses those discrete tangible or visible things that are inanimate and produced by human endeavor; that is, that are either fabricated or given form by human activity. These range, in physical form, from built works to images and written documents. They range in purpose from utilitarian to the aesthetic. Also included are landscape features that provide the context for the built environment (e.g., paintings, amphorae, facades, cathedrals, Brewster chairs, gardens).  

Brand Names: The Brand Names facet was recently added to allow additions from the conservation community, particularly where a material or process does not have a generic name (e.g., Art Sorb (TM); Aquazol (TM); Papersave Process (TM)).","Art, Architecture",Art; Architecture,"TGN, ULAN, CONA, IA, CDWA, CCO.",http://bartoc.org/en/node/75,048-94,D35100,Thesaurus

From 1983, this authority file is developed in cooperation with the Ministry of National Education and the Public Information Library (BPI), under the name LAMECH (Jurisdiction, Collective and Hierarchical Subject Authority List) . In 1987, the National Library and the Ministry of National Education teamed up to jointly manage and disseminate the repertoire of authority-matters, called the RAMEAU (Directory of Unified Encyclopedic and Alphabetical Authorities). Initially using only the data of the National Library, RAMEAU is now also enriched by creations and updates from university libraries. In 2001, a new convention replaced the one of 1987, in order to better take into account the development of RAMEAU, which has since become a national indexing language: it is now also used by public reading libraries, as well as only by a number of research libraries and private organizations.
